# CodeClause Artificial Intelligence Internship Projects

This repository showcases the work I completed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at [CodeClause](https://codeclause.com). The internship provided valuable hands-on experience with predictive modeling, real-world datasets, and practical AI applications.

During the internship, I successfully completed two focused machine learning projects aimed at solving domain-specific problems in real estate and finance.

## Projects Included

### 1. House Price Prediction
Developed a regression model to estimate house prices based on features such as area, location, number of rooms, and other housing attributes. This project focused on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Linear regression modeling and evaluation

### 2. Gold Price Prediction
Created a machine learning model to predict daily gold prices using historical financial indicators. This project involved:
- Time series-based data exploration
- Feature correlation analysis
- Regression modeling using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using performance metrics such as RÂ² and RMSE

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression, model evaluation tools)
